# Russian-Ukrainian keyboard layout for Mac OS users

Hi, my name is Constantine. I live in eastern Ukraine where most people speak Russian. But when you work with the documents you often need to use Ukrainian language. These languages are phonetically very close, differing only by a few letters, hense adding a third keyboard layout makes life harder sometimes. That is why I have created a ru-ua keyboard layout where you can use Ukrainian symbols using an option key but still have a russian keyboard layout. Also the flag on this layout is Ukrainian (hope I am not the only one who wanted to change russian flag in russian keyboard layout).

If you communicate mostly in Ukrainian language and seldom need russian characters please check out [UA-RU keyboard layout by shkoliar](https://github.com/shkoliar/ua-ru-osx-keylayout).


## Modifiers
This layout is a default russian keyboard layout for MacOS with modifications:
* ⌥ + и = і
* ⌥ + ъ = ї
* ⌥ + э = є
* ⌥ + ё = ґ
* ⌥ + г = ₴


## Installation

There are 2 ways of installation:


### 1. Using git (recommended)
Move the keyboard layout `Russian-Ukrainian.bundle` to `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/` directory. 

    git clone https://github.com/constantinchik/ru-ua-osx-keylayout.git
    cd ru-ua-osx-keylayout/
    sudo cp -r Russian-Ukraine.bundle /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/
